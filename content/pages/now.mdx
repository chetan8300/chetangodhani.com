(This page is the page [now](https://nownownow.com/about), if you have a blog, let's make it too)

Welcome to my blog, which I've just launched in September 2020! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here, and I will try to put my best effort into every post.

By day, I work as a Software Engineer, delving into various web technologies like React, Node.js, Laravel, and Go. I love tinkering with these tools, whether it's crafting sleek front-end interfaces or building powerful back-end systems. You'll often find me immersed in projects.

In addition to my day job, I'm always eager to expand my skills. Currently, I'm diving into the world of Golang and React Native and exploring DevOps concepts.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure!
