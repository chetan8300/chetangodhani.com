(This page is the page [now](https://nownownow.com/about), if you have a blog, let's make it too)

I am just starting this blog now(September 2020). I will try to write with best effort.

I am working as a Fullstack Freelance Developer in web technologies including React, Node and Laravel, using tools such as Visual Studio Code, Git, Github, and also Bitbucket.

And I am learning React Native and some DevOps concepts with freelance jobs which I have listed on [learn](/learn) page.
